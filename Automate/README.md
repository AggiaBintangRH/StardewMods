**Automate** is a [Stardew Valley](http://stardewvalley.net/) mod which lets you place a chest
next to machines (like a furnace, cheese press, bee house, etc), and the machines will
automatically pull raw items from the chest and push processed items into it.

### Factories
You can connect chests to any number of machines, and they don't all need to be the same type. A
chest will connect to any adjacent machine (i.e. one tile in every direction including
diagonal), any machines adjacent to those machines, etc. You can press `U` (configurable) to see
which machines are being automated.

Here are a few example factories. You can increase production by just adding more machines.

* **Automatic crab pots**  
  A worm bin produces bait, which is fed into the crab pots, which harvest fish and recycle trash.
  The final products are stored in the chest.

* **Automatic refined quartz factory**  
  A crystalarium produces quartz, which is smelted into refined quartz, which is stored in the
  chest.

* **Automatic iridium mead factory**  
  A bee house produces honey, which is turned into mead, which is aged to iridium quality, which is
  stored in the chest.

* **Automatic iridium bar factory**  
  A statue of perfection produces iridium ore, which is smelted into bars, which are stored in the
  chest.

* **Semi-automatic iridium cheese factory**  
  Put your milk in the chest and it'll be turned into cheese, then aged to iridium quality, then
  put back in the chest.

## Configuration
The mod will work fine out of the box, but you can tweak its settings by editing the `config.json`
file if you want. These are the available settings:

setting           | what it affects
----------------- | -------------------
`Controls` | The configured controller, keyboard, and mouse buttons (see [key bindings](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Key_bindings)). You can separate multiple buttons with commas. The default value is `U` to toggle the automation overlay.
`AutomationInterval` | Default `60`. The number of update ticks between each automation cycle (one second is â‰ˆ60 ticks).
`VerboseLogging` | Default `false`. Whether to write more detailed information about what the mod is doing to the log file. This is useful for troubleshooting, but may impact performance and should generally be disabled.

## Versions
