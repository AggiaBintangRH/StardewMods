# Release notes
## 1.5 (upcoming)
* Added `Year` condition.
* Added support for all conditions in `Action: Load` patches.
* Added support for multiple values in the `Target` field (like `"Target": "Festivals, Maps/Festivals"`).
* Added config tokens to `patch summary`.
* Added warning when a config field has `AllowValues` but a patch checks for an unlisted value.
* Removed patch prevalidation, which warned modders about issues like patch conflicts before they
  happened. That validation required a number of restrictions on how conditions and tokens could be
  used. Based on discussion with content pack modders on Discord, lifting those restrictions was
  more valuable than the prevalidation.
* Removed image preloading, which is no longer needed with SMAPI 2.8+.
